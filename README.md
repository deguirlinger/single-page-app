# React-Rails

Up until this point, we've been using create-react-app to build our applications, and we've been using a separate Rails applications to explore Rails and APIs.  Have you wondered if Rails, as full featured as it is, could be the platform for the API and the React app together?  If so, it was a good question to ask, and as you may have guessed, Rails can also serve right from normal old erb pages.  Not only can it do so, but the solution is very elegant, and using Rails in this way allows us as developers to build larger and more interesting applications in an organized way.

Let's explore how Rails and React are integrated by constructing the simplest possible Rails app, and the simplest possible React component and getting them to work together.
